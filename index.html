<h1>Dedicated Listeners</h1><span> was set up single-handedly by Goldsmiths
students in response to a clear need for an increase in immediate, personal,
one-to-one emotional support for students who may be in emotional crisis, feeling lonely,
isolated or simply in need to be listened to and have a safe space where they can feel comfortable, whilst on campus.

Goldsmiths University students have worked tirelessly to establish its first completely confidential,
student led listening support service through gaining expert advice and training from nightline volunteers.
Dedicated Listeners have adapted to work within the rhythm of the university and its students,
so that it serves both volunteers as well as those who use the service as best as it can.
