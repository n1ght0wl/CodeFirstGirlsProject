  <p>If new students are also interested in joining Dedicated listeners; Training is provided in the skill of listening (which consists of giving non directional, empathic and non judgemental responses) through in depth practical exercises throughout their time volunteering. Emergency procedure is also covered which is in line with university protocol. Student volunteers do not give advice but can offer signposting to official support services within the university on request.Trainings run twice a year. Once in October and once in January. Dates will be confirmed nearer the time.</p>

  <p>Our volunteers will gain invaluable skills and experience in what its like to run and be part of a well being support service and will learn of the responsibility it entails. They will develop skills in teamwork, effective communication, organisation and time management. They will learn to work with different people of all ages and backgrounds, to use their personal initiative and judgement to respond appropriately in the moment but also according to their training protocol. They will also learn how to respond, practically, sensitively and efficiently under pressure and how to establish professional working boundaries.</p>

  <p>The training has been found to be particularly useful for Psychology students and anyone who is considering entering the care profession. Many of our volunteers see this project as an opportunity for them to gain real experience of what it is like to support others in a professional manner. This will therefore serve as fantastic experience for potential employers. The time spent volunteering for Dedicated Listeners has already been accepted as suitable experience for Gold award students, furthermore the workshops we run throughout the year will also count towards the Gold Award. From last years feedback of the impact the workshops, we can confidently say that our volunteers found not only did their skills improve in listening and supporting in a formal setting but also they noticed that the training also helped to deepen their relationships at home and with their peers.</p>

<p>The service requires volunteer listeners to attend all training sessions, team and mentor meetings, to give two hours of their time every two weeks to volunteer listening, to offer support to their team members when on shift if needed, to be in regular communication with their coordinator and to behave professionally at all times. Communication is key within the service and we therefore cannot stress enough, how important it is to stay connected with your team and to report any issues to a coordinator regarding shifts or service issues with efficiency and honesty. This ensures we can create a most professional, considerate and open working environment.</p>

  <p>It is not mandatory but it would also be ideal if volunteers are able to offer support where they can with small administrative or promotional tasks when there is a service event. It would be helpful for volunteers to be available to do extra shifts as and when is needed if they are able to (due to a sickness for example). Finally, there is ample opportunity for students to practise their creative skills or to take on new responsibilities in a safe and supportive community, as the service is continuously changing and expanding and looking for new innovative input and energy</p>
